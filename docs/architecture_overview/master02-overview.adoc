= Overview

This document provides an overview of the openEHR architecture. It commences with a description of the specification project, followed by an overview of the model structure and packages. Key global semantics including security, archetyping, identification, version and paths are then described. The relationship to published standards is indicated, and finally, the approach to building Implementation Technology Specifications (ITSs) is outlined.

== The openEHR Specification Program

The openEHR Specification Program is responsible for developing the specifications of openEHR, from which the openEHR Health Computing Platform is implemented. The outputs of the program consist of a number of _components_, as shown in the diagram below, with each component consisting of one or more separate specifications. The components shown in blue on the left define the _openEHR platform architecture_, and are expressed in a combination of UML models and formal language specifications. They can be implmented using typical software engineering technologies. The formal artefacts (e.g. UML models, Antlr grammars etc) are published online for this purpose.

The remaining components define artefacts outside the openEHR platform architecture.

On the lower right-hand side is the Terminology (TERM) component, which contains formal artefacts representing openEHR's internal terminology, along with expressions of various IETF and other vocabularies (language names, territory names, MIME types, etc) that are not typically published in a directly usable format.

On the upper-right hand side in orange is the Impelementation Technology Specifications (ITS) component, which consists of concrete expressions of the formal specificaitons in the other components, in various programming, API and schema languages. The artefacts in this component provide the directly usable basis for building an implementation of the openEHR health computing platform, any one of its components, or client applications or tools.

The final component on the top right is the Conformance (CNF) component, containing a formal definition of the notional openEHR Platform and how to test it in a standard way. This is used as the basis for openEHR product certification and also for procurement tender specification.

The specifications published by openEHR constitute the _primary reference for all openEHR semantics_. The presentation style is deliberately intended to be clear and semantically close to the _ideas_ being communicated. Accordingly, the specifications do not follow any particular programming language or idiom, but instead use  various formalisms and illustrations appropriate to each topic.

Change control is performed by the {openehr_sec}[openEHR Specifications Editorial Committee (SEC)], using a formal process based on Problem Reports (PRs) and Change Reqests (CRs), and a formal release cycle. The details are described in the {openehr_specification_program}[Specifications Program part of the openEHR website]. 

The openEHR specification documents and related formal artefacts may be found on the {openehr_specs_home}[specifications home page]. The documents are maintained in {asciidoctor}[Asciidoctor] source form, and make heavy use of included formal elements, including extracted UML class texts and diagrams, as well as grammar files.
