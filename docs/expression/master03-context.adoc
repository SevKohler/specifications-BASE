= Expression Definition Context

Expressions in the openEHR Expression Language are defined with respect to a _data context_, with the relationship being defined by _bindings_. Each binding connects a symbolic variable used in expressions to a data source or target in the data context.

=== External Queries

An expression referring to an externally defined query, possibly including arguments, may be defined using the variable declaration syntax. The general pattern is as follows:

--------
    varname: Type
    varname := query (context, query_name, arg1, arg2, ...)
--------

Examples include:

--------
    date_of_birth: ISO8601_DATE
    has_diabetes, is_female: Boolean

    date_of_birth := query ("ehr", "date_of_birth")
    has_diabetes := query ("ehr", "has_diagnosis", "[snomed_ct::1234567]")
    is_female := query ("ehr", "is_female")
--------

Any number of arguments can be included.
